## Introduction

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcarlyle/udacity_deep_learning_foundations__p1/master/cyclenetlogo.png "Cycle net") There are a lot of libraries available (like Tensorflow) to help build Neural Networks, however it is important to understand the basic building blocks. This is especially important for machine learning which requires various aspects of statisitics, mathematics, computing, information science and some understanding of the hardware available (STEM):

+ Data manipulation - an understand of how to shape the data
+ Hyper parameters - how to tune the network to achieve convergence in a suitable time with the avialable computing power
+ Gradient descent - to converge towards the optimal solution
+ Back propogation - to train the network and update it's weights

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset "Data set").
